It is a dark night, no moon, no light. Several people gathered in a house and 
light one hundred candles. They sit arround these candles and take turns to tell
ghost stories. After one story, one candle blown out. The lighted candles are becoming less and less.

As the stories continue, the the lights grow dimmer and dimmer, the walls of the house offering no illumination to 
the dark world these people reside in. From within their circle the figures peer out into the darkness slowly growing
closer and closer. Suddenley the figures fall silent as they realize there numbers have grown smaller. Not one person
remains without a candle. They fall silent, there eyes peering from one another to the darkness enclosing them, not
one of them daring to speak another word less they to be vanquished into the dark.

Slowly and silently, the last of the candles begin to fade. as they each disappear, one by one, into a puff
of smoke, the people become fanatically grasping for the light. As the candlelight continues to fade, they pile 
together into the middle, where the last candle dimly illuminates only their facees. With so little light, the
people on the outside become consumed by the darkness.
