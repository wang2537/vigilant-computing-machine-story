It is a dark night, no moon, no light. Several people gathered in a house and 
light one hundred candles. They sit arround these candles and take turns to tell
ghost stories. After one story, one candle blown out. The lighted candles are becoming less and less.

As the stories continue, the the lights grow dimmer and dimmer, the walls of the house offering no illumination to 
the dark world these people reside in. From within their circle the figures peer out into the darkness slowly growing
closer and closer. Suddenley the figures fall silent as they realize there numbers have grown smaller. Not one person
remains without a candle. They fall silent, there eyes peering from one another to the darkness enclosing them, not
one of them daring to speak another word less they to be vanquished into the dark.

Slowly and silently, the last of the candles begin to fade. as they each disappear, one by one, into a puff
of smoke, the people become fanatically grasping for the light. As the candlelight continues to fade, they pile 
together into the middle, where the last candle dimly illuminates only their facees. With so little light, the
people on the outside become consumed by the darkness.

They hold each other tightly, as they feel the darkness creeping in. As they feel each other disappearing into the 
night, one person remains. He can feel a cold breeze gently blow on his skin. He desperately clings onto the only
light he has left. After the last candle has been blown out, everything becomes completely black. 
No light, no hope, nothing. 

Suddenly, a ghost named Aoandon appeared, said, "These ghost stoies you told summoned me, and I will bring you into the hell"
"You need to stay at the hell for 100000 years, after that you can get out"
The man was very regret, but he has no choice but to let Aoandon bring him to the hell.
